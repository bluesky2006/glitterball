A small, stylised website promoting Glitterball ‚Äî a club night I co-run in Somerset.

## What is it?
The glitterball website is a fun side project that brings together my love of electronic music, visual aesthetics, and front-end development. This site promotes the event, showcases the brand identity, and features playful, interactive design choices to reflect the energy of the night.

## Background

glitterball is a resurrection of a club night I co-ran in London nearly a decade ago. As part of our revival, I gave the brand a fresh look inspired by 80s/90s rave flyers and vintage stock photography, drawing assets from archives like the Internet Archive.

## Development Story

This site began life as a ‚Äúvibe-coding‚Äù experiment using ChatGPT, before I formally trained as a developer. Early tinkering with HTML/CSS and JS planted the seed that eventually led me to pursue software development full-time.

As I progressed through my bootcamp, I revisited the codebase to:
- Refactor components and clean up logic
- Add accessible markup and improve layout responsiveness
- Introduce quirky, interactive UI elements (a few still with AI help!)
- Host and deploy the site using GitHub

### Tech Used
- HTML5 / CSS3 / Vanilla JavaScript
- Git + GitHub for version control
